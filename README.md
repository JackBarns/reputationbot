# reputationbot
open-source discord reputation bot + admin commands (SQL)
Bot is written in C#

You can edit the bot's token in Program.cs

You require MySQL, you can edit the SQL details inside the generated config file found in {EXE LOCATION}\cfg\sqlInfo.txt

To view the layout of the database, view the SQL HANDLER class.

I suggest not using root as the mysql user.
